## What is a Virtual Private Cloud?
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a private cloud computing environment hosted within a public cloud. A virtual private cloud reserves its some of its resources to be accessed by a single customer in a pool of a crowded public cloud with various customers assessing computing resources.

## Public Cloud vs Private Cloud
In a public cloud, resources such as servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. The cloud service provider has the sole responsibility for all management and maintenance of the system. Public cloud deployments are **faster than on-premises infrastructures** and with an **almost infinitely scalable platform**. These deployments are generally used to provide web-based email and testing and development environments. Some of the advantages of public clouds include:
- Lower costs
- High reliability
- Scalability
- No maintenance

A private cloud, on the other hand, are services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network. Only selected users instead of the general public are allowed to use this service. Private clouds gives businesses the benefits of hosting in a public cloud - such as scalability and elasticity. It also provide additional benefits including **higher level of security and privacy** through both company firewalls and internal hosting, ensuring that sensitive data will not be accessible to third-party providers. However, one major drawback is that it **requires the same management and maintenance expenses** as traditional datacenter ownership as companies are accountable to managing the private cloud.
