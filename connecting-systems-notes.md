## Public Cloud vs Private Cloud
In a public cloud, resources such as servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. The cloud service provider has the sole responsibility for all management and maintenance of the system. Public cloud deployments are faster than on-premises infrastructures and with an almost infinitely scalable platform. These deployments are generally used to provide web-based email and testing and development environments. Some of the advantages of public clouds include:
..* Lower costs
..* High reliability
..* Scalability
